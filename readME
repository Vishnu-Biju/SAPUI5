  # Requirements

       * Node.js
       * npm or yarn for dependency management
       
  # Installation
        Use the following command to install the dependencies:

        # npm install
                    
  # Running the App
      Use the following command to run the app locally for development in watch mode:

       # npm start

       The app will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/index.html.

  # Debugging the App

        You can directly debug the original TypeScript code in the browser, which is supplied via sourcemaps. If the browser doesn't automatically jump to the TypeScript code when setting breakpoints, use Ctrl+P in Chrome to open the *.ts file you want to debug.
    
   # Building the App

        #Unoptimized Build
        To build the project and get an app that can be deployed, run the following command:

        # npm run build
    
    Then, start the generated package with
       
       #npm run start:dist

  # Optimized Build

      For an optimized self-contained build, run:

      # npm run build:opt

  # Then, start the generated package with:

     # npm run start:dist
